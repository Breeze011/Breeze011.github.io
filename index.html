<h1>Brianna Delaney</h1>
<p>I am a student at Bob Jones currently studying Information Technology.
I previously graduated from Bob Jones with a Bachelors in Business Administration.</p>

<p>I enjoy camping and sports, and lots of other things. 
I recently spent my summer at Camp Chetek working with the inner city ministry that they have there for about 7 weeks. 
Inner city kids from all over the midwest come out to camp for a week and hear the Gospel, many for the first time. 
It is a cool organization to be apart of mainly because I was an inner city who got to experience that at a younger age and I could never shake 
how awesome it was to get away from my environment, meet new people and learn new things. 
I started going to this camp when I was 15 and I have not left yet.

<p> At school I play basketball for the intercollegiate team. 
It is hard work but it is also a lot of fun. 
Being on the team is also an outreach in a way. 
Sometimes we are able to meet new people and share that Gospel with them and that is always fun. 
Our main  minstry that we have been doing for the last couple years is the Kroctober fest at the Kroc Center Greenville. 
Kids from Greenville come out the center throws a carnival for them so that is something we all enjoy doing.
